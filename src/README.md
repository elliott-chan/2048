# 2048

A small local implementation of the 2048 game (Tkinter GUI) with a simple offline AI helper.

## Quick Start

Run the GUI: `python src/main.py`

## Differences from Original 2048

- **Initial tiles**: This version spawns a *random number* of `2` tiles on the initial board (between 2 and 16).

## Offline AI Suggestion (Monte-Carlo) 

- The project includes a simple offline AI used by the sidebar "Suggestion" button.
